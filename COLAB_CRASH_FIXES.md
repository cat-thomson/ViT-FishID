# Google Colab Crash Fixes - ViT-FishID MAE Training

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED

### Issue 1: CUDNN Library Incompatibility
**Error:** `Could not load symbol cudnnGetLibConfig`

**Root Cause:** PyTorch was installed with incompatible CUDNN version for the Colab environment.

**Fix Applied:**
- Uninstall existing PyTorch completely
- Install specific compatible versions: `torch==2.0.1+cu118`
- Force kernel restart to clear CUDNN conflicts
- Add compatibility verification

### Issue 2: Memory Management Issues
**Error:** Immediate kernel restart when running Section 4

**Root Cause:** MAE model was too large for typical Colab GPU memory (12-16GB T4).

**Fix Applied:**
- Reduced encoder dimensions: 768 → 512
- Reduced encoder depth: 12 → 8 layers  
- Reduced decoder dimensions: 512 → 256
- Reduced decoder depth: 8 → 4 layers
- Added progressive memory checking
- Added memory allocation monitoring

### Issue 3: Dependency Version Conflicts
**Error:** Import conflicts with timm and transformers

**Fix Applied:**
- Pinned specific working versions
- Removed dependency on timm's ViT blocks
- Implemented custom lightweight transformer blocks
- Added version verification after installation

## 🛠️ HOW TO RUN THE NOTEBOOK (STEP-BY-STEP)

### Step 1: Run Sections 1-2 Normally
```python
# Section 1: Environment Setup - should work fine
# Section 2: Mount Google Drive - should work fine
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (CRITICAL)
```python
# Section 2: Install Dependencies
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This will restart your kernel!
# After kernel restart, continue to next cell automatically
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
```python
# The verification cell will run automatically
# Look for "✅ CUDNN compatibility test passed!"
# If you see this, the CUDNN issue is fixed
```

### Step 4: Run Data Setup
```python
# Section 3: Should work normally now
```

### Step 5: Run MAE Components
```python
# Section 4: Now memory-optimized
# Should show progressive memory usage
# Look for "✅ Model successfully moved to GPU!"
```

## 🔍 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before running Section 4, verify:

- [ ] ✅ CUDNN compatibility test passed
- [ ] 📊 GPU memory > 8GB available  
- [ ] 🔧 No import errors in dependencies
- [ ] 💾 Fish dataset successfully loaded
- [ ] 🎯 DEVICE = cuda (not cpu)

## 📊 NEW MODEL SPECIFICATIONS

**Original MAE (causing crash):**
- Encoder: 768d, 12 layers, 12 heads (~140M params)
- Decoder: 512d, 8 layers, 16 heads
- Memory: ~14GB GPU required

**Optimized MAE (should work):**
- Encoder: 512d, 8 layers, 8 heads (~52M params)  
- Decoder: 256d, 4 layers, 8 heads
- Memory: ~8GB GPU required

## 🚀 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIXES

1. **Section 1:** Normal environment check
2. **Section 2:** Kernel restart (this is normal!)
3. **Section 2b:** Verification shows no CUDNN errors
4. **Section 3:** Normal data loading
5. **Section 4:** Progressive model creation with memory monitoring
6. **Section 4:** Successful forward pass test

## 🆘 IF STILL CRASHING

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Restart Runtime:** Runtime → Factory Reset Runtime
2. **Check GPU Type:** Runtime → View Resources (ensure T4/V100/A100)
3. **Use Colab Pro:** For guaranteed higher memory GPU

### Fallback Options:
1. Reduce batch size to 16 or 8
2. Further reduce model dimensions
3. Use gradient checkpointing (if needed)

### Memory Monitoring:
```python
# Check GPU memory anytime:
print(f"Memory used: {torch.cuda.memory_allocated(0)/1024**3:.1f} GB")
print(f"Memory cached: {torch.cuda.memory_reserved(0)/1024**3:.1f} GB")
```

## 🎯 SUCCESS INDICATORS

You'll know the fixes worked when you see:

```
✅ CUDNN compatibility test passed!
✅ Model created successfully in CPU memory  
✅ Model successfully moved to GPU!
📊 Model memory usage: X.XX GB
✅ Forward pass successful!
🎭 MAE MODEL READY FOR PRETRAINING!
```

## 📞 SUPPORT

If issues persist:
1. Check that you're using GPU runtime (not CPU)
2. Verify you have sufficient Google Drive space
3. Try running one cell at a time
4. Monitor the Colab resource usage panel

**The notebook should now run without crashes on standard Colab GPUs!**
