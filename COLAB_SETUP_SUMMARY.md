## 🏃‍♂️ How to Get Started (5 Minutes!)

### Step 1: Open Google Colab
1. Go to [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Click the **"GitHub"** tab
3. Enter repository: `cat-thomson/ViT-FishID`
4. Select: `ViT_FishID_Colab_Training.ipynb`
5. Click **"Open in Colab"**

### Step 2: Enable GPU
1. Click **Runtime** → **Change runtime type**
2. Set **Hardware accelerator** to **GPU**
3. Click **Save** (runtime will restart)

### Step 3: Prepare Your Data
Upload your `fish_cutouts.zip` file to Google Drive:
- Upload the ZIP file to your Google Drive (any location)
- The notebook will automatically extract it for faster training
- ZIP should contain `labeled/` and `unlabeled/` folders

### Step 4: Run the Notebook
1. Execute each cell in order by pressing **Shift + Enter**
2. When prompted, mount Google Drive (click the link and authorize)
3. Update the `ZIP_FILE_PATH` in Step 5 to point to your `fish_cutouts.zip`
4. Wait for automatic extraction (may take a few minutes)
5. Optionally adjust training parameters in Step 7
6. Start training in Step 8!

### Step 5: Monitor Training
- Training takes 2-3 hours for 50 epochs
- Watch accuracy increase in real-time
- Models are automatically saved every 10 epochs

## 📊 What to Expect

### Performance Targets:
- **Training Time**: 2-3 hours (50 epochs on Tesla T4)
- **Memory Usage**: ~6-8GB GPU memory
- **Expected Accuracy**: 75-85% validation accuracy
- **Checkpoints**: Saved every 10 epochs + best model

### GPU Compatibility:
| GPU Type | Batch Size | Training Time | Expected Result |
|----------|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Tesla T4 | 16 | 2-3 hours | 80-85% accuracy |
| Tesla K80 | 8 | 4-5 hours | 75-80% accuracy |
| Tesla V100 | 32 | 1-2 hours | 85%+ accuracy |

## 🛠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### "CUDA out of memory"
**Solution**: In Step 7, change:
```python
TRAINING_CONFIG['batch_size'] = 8  # or even 4
```

### "Data directory not found"
**Solution**: Check your `ZIP_FILE_PATH` in Step 5:
```python
ZIP_FILE_PATH = '/content/drive/MyDrive/fish_cutouts.zip'
```
Make sure:
- The ZIP file is uploaded to Google Drive
- The path is correct (case-sensitive)
- The file is named exactly `fish_cutouts.zip`

### "Runtime disconnected"
**Solution**: 
- Keep browser tab active
- Training resumes from last checkpoint automatically

### Low accuracy
**Solution**: Adjust parameters in Step 7:
```python
TRAINING_CONFIG['epochs'] = 75  # Train longer
TRAINING_CONFIG['pseudo_label_threshold'] = 0.5  # Lower threshold
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### 1. Data Preparation
- ✅ **Upload fish_cutouts.zip** to Google Drive
- ✅ **Check ZIP structure** (labeled/ and unlabeled/ folders inside)
- ✅ **Note upload location** for Step 5 in the notebook
- ✅ **Wait for extraction** - notebook handles this automatically

### 2. Training Optimization
- ✅ **Start with 25-50 epochs** to test setup
- ✅ **Use W&B logging** for experiment tracking
- ✅ **Monitor consistency loss** (should be > 0.001)

### 3. Resource Management
- ✅ **Keep Colab tab active** to prevent disconnection
- ✅ **Download important checkpoints** after training
- ✅ **Use free tier wisely** (daily GPU limits apply)

## 🎯 Success Checklist

After running the notebook, you should see:

✅ GPU detected and allocated  
✅ Google Drive mounted successfully  
✅ Dataset loaded with correct class count  
✅ Training starts with decreasing loss  
✅ Validation accuracy improves over epochs  
✅ Models saved to Google Drive  

## 📥 After Training

Your trained model will be saved to:
```
/content/drive/MyDrive/ViT-FishID_Training_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
├── checkpoints/
│   ├── model_best.pth          # ← Use this for inference!
│   ├── model_latest.pth
│   └── model_epoch_XX.pth
├── training_config.json
└── training_summary.txt
```

## 🆘 Need Help?

1. **Read error messages carefully** - they contain helpful hints
2. **Check the COLAB_GUIDE.md** for detailed troubleshooting
3. **Try smaller batch sizes** if you get memory errors
4. **Restart runtime** and try again (Runtime → Restart runtime)
