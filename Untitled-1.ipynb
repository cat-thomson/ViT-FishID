    "## 🎯 What This Notebook Does\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a **fully supervised learning pipeline** for fish species classification using:\n",
    "\n",
    "**🤖 Vision Transformer (ViT)**: State-of-the-art transformer architecture for image classification\n",
    "**📊 Supervised Learning**: Uses only labeled fish images with ground truth\n",
    "**🔍 Data Filtering**: Automatically removes species with fewer than 2 images\n",
    "**☁️ Google Colab**: Cloud-based training with GPU acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Expected Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Time**: 2-4 hours for 100 epochs\n",
    "- **GPU Requirements**: T4/V100/A100 (Colab Pro recommended)\n",
    "- **Expected Accuracy**: 85-95% on fish species classification\n",
    "- **Data Requirements**: Minimum 2 images per species class\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ What You Need\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fish Dataset**: Labeled fish images organized by species (upload to Google Drive)\n",
    "2. **Google Colab Pro**: Recommended for longer training sessions\n",
    "3. **Weights & Biases Account**: Optional for experiment tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Key Differences from Semi-Supervised Version\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Supervised Only**: No unlabeled data used\n",
    "- ✅ **Data Filtering**: Species with <2 images automatically excluded\n",
    "- ✅ **Simplified Training**: Standard supervised learning approach\n",
    "- ✅ **Faster Training**: No consistency loss or pseudo-labeling overhead"
